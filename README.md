I have implemented the program in python

Adjacency matrices are written to a file in the same working directory as adj_matrix_file1..... 

The program works for both 3*3 and 6*6 patches.

forest.jpg is the input file.

Install the following packages:

1)OpenCV

2)numpy

3)matplotlib

4)os

5)pillow

To run the Program:

        Python mine.py
